moodle-block_vcl
================

A Moodle block for connecting to an Apache Virtual Computing Lab system

Provides options for creating and managing reservations in the VCL from
within Moodle. Additionally, the block provides options for auto-creating
course-based groups within the VCL, synchronizing group membership with
the Moodle course enrollment.

The block is designed to work with a patched version of the 2.3 release
of the Apache Virtual Computing Lab. Furthermore, it assumes that the 
VCL is set up to use Shibboleth-based authentication.

Some additional setup is required in order to use this block with a
VCL System. These steps are described in the project wiki:
